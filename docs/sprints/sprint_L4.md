# Sprint L4: Bilingual Testing, QA & Refinements

**Goal:** Conduct comprehensive testing and quality assurance for the bilingual (English and Spanish) Permisoria platform. Identify and resolve any linguistic errors, layout issues, functional discrepancies between language versions, and ensure a polished, intuitive user experience in both languages.

**Key Documents Referenced:**
* `I18N_GUIDELINES.md` (for consistency checks)
* All frontend component and page files (as they are now internationalized)
* Locale resource files (`./public/locales/en/*.json`, `./public/locales/es/*.json` - fully translated from Sprint L2, implemented in L3)
* All user flow documentation (`app_flow_document.md`, user stories, etc.) to ensure flows work in both languages.
* Issue/Bug Tracker.

## Task 1: Comprehensive Linguistic Quality Assurance (QA) for Spanish
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%

### Subtask 1.1: Full Review of Spanish Translations by a Native/Fluent Speaker
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:** Engage a native or fluent Spanish speaker (ideally familiar with Puerto Rican Spanish nuances if targeting that specific dialect, or a neutral Latin American Spanish) to review all translated strings in the Spanish locale files (`/public/locales/es/*.json`).
* **Focus:**
    * **Accuracy:** Is the translation correct?
    * **Contextual Appropriateness:** Does the translation make sense in the specific UI context where it's used? (Requires tester to see strings in-situ or have good contextual notes).
    * **Consistency:** Are terms translated consistently throughout the application? (e.g., "Business Owner" should always be translated the same way).
    * **Tone and Formality:** Does the tone match the application's intended style (e.g., professional, friendly)? Is the level of formality appropriate (e.g., "t√∫" vs. "usted" - decide on one and be consistent).
    * **Grammar and Spelling:** Check for any grammatical errors or typos.
    * **Cultural Appropriateness:** Ensure no translations are inadvertently offensive or culturally insensitive.
* **Deliverable:** A list of corrections, suggestions, and feedback for the Spanish translations.
* **AI Action:** Provide a checklist/template for linguistic QA. This task largely relies on human expertise.

### Subtask 1.2: Update Spanish Locale Files with Linguistic QA Feedback
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:** Implement all approved corrections and suggestions from the linguistic QA review into the Spanish JSON files.
* **AI Action:** Assist in making the text changes to the JSON files based on the feedback.

## Task 2: Bilingual Functional Testing
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%

### Subtask 2.1: Execute All Key User Flows in Both English and Spanish
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:** Repeat the E2E test scenarios (defined in Sprint 10.A or earlier testing phases) for all user roles, executing each scenario entirely in English, and then entirely in Spanish.
* **Focus:**
    * **Functionality:** Does the application behave the same way in both languages? (e.g., form submissions, data saving, API calls, status updates).
    * **Data Integrity:** Is data entered in one language displayed correctly if the language is switched (for user-generated content, it should remain in the language it was entered)? Are system-generated statuses (e.g., "VERIFIED") translated correctly?
    * **Navigation:** Do all links and navigation elements work correctly and lead to the expected pages in both languages?
    * **Error Handling:** Are error messages displayed correctly and translated appropriately in Spanish?
    * **Dynamic Content:** Verify strings with interpolated variables and pluralizations render correctly in both languages.
* **AI Action:** Guide the execution of E2E test scenarios, prompting for specific checks in both English and Spanish.

### Subtask 2.2: Test Language Switching Robustness
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:**
    * Switch languages at various points in user flows (e.g., in the middle of a form, on a detail page, in a modal).
    * Verify that the UI updates to the selected language without loss of data or application state (where appropriate).
    * Confirm language preference persistence (localStorage) across browser sessions and tabs.
* **AI Action:** Suggest specific scenarios for testing language switching.

### Subtask 2.3: Test Locale-Specific Formatting
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:** Re-verify that dates, times, and numbers (if any are specifically formatted) display correctly according to English (US) and Spanish (e.g., Puerto Rico if specific locale `es-PR` is targeted and supported by formatting libraries, otherwise general `es`) conventions.
* **AI Action:** Remind of common date/number format differences to check (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY vs. MM/DD/YYYY, decimal separators).

## Task 3: Bilingual UI/UX and Layout Review & Refinement
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%

### Subtask 3.1: Check for Layout Issues Caused by Spanish Text Length
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:** Thoroughly review all pages and components in the Spanish version. Spanish text can often be 20-30% longer than English.
* **Identify & Fix:**
    * Text overflows or truncation in buttons, tabs, navigation items, labels, table cells, cards, etc.
    * Broken layouts or misaligned elements due to text length.
    * Inconsistent font sizes or line heights if adjustments were made previously for one language.
* **Solutions:** May involve adjusting Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., padding, width, font size for specific locales if necessary, though responsive design should handle much of this), tweaking component design, or, in rare cases, slightly rephrasing translations for brevity while maintaining meaning (consult with translator).
* **AI Action:** Highlight common UI elements susceptible to text length issues. Suggest CSS/Tailwind strategies for responsive text handling.

### Subtask 3.2: Ensure Visual Consistency Between Language Versions
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:** Compare the English and Spanish versions of pages side-by-side (if possible) or by switching frequently.
* Check for any unintended visual discrepancies in styling, spacing, or element appearance that are not related to text length.
* **AI Action:** Suggest a visual spot-checking process.

### Subtask 3.3: Review Readability and Scannability in Spanish
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:** Ensure that the chosen fonts, line heights, and text spacing work well for Spanish text, maintaining good readability.
* **AI Action:** Prompt for a subjective review of readability in Spanish.

## Task 4: Update Documentation and Guidelines
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%

### Subtask 4.1: Update `I18N_GUIDELINES.md`
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:** Incorporate any learnings, new conventions, or refined processes for handling i18n/l10n that emerged during Sprints L1-L4.
* Add notes on testing localized features.
* Document the process for updating translations or adding new languages in the future.
* **AI Action:** Suggest sections to add or update in the i18n guidelines.

### Subtask 4.2: Update User-Facing Documentation (if any)
* **Status:** [Pending]
* **Progress:** 0%
* **Action:** If any user guides or FAQs were created (e.g., in Sprint 10.B), ensure they are now also available in Spanish or clearly state that the application supports both languages.
* **AI Action:** Check if user documentation needs translation or updates regarding language support.
