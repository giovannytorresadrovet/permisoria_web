# Backend Architecture for Permisoria Navigation System

I'll architect a robust backend solution for the Permisoria navigation system we've implemented. As a platform handling sensitive business permit data, we need a secure, scalable, and performant backend implementation that properly supports the navigation components.

## 1. Core Backend Services

Let's structure our backend services for the navigation components following a service-based architecture pattern:

```
/lib/
  /services/
    /auth/
      - authService.ts          # Authentication management
      - permissionService.ts    # Permission & role management
    /user/
      - userService.ts          # User profile management
      - preferenceService.ts    # User preferences (theme, language) 
    /notification/
      - notificationService.ts  # Notification management
```

Let's implement each of these services:

Now I'll develop the user, notification, and preference services to complete our backend architecture for the navigation system:

Now I'll create the API routes and implement the Prisma schema to support our navigation system. Let's focus on the necessary backend infrastructure to tie our frontend components to the data sources.

## 1. Database Schema (Prisma)

First, let's define the schema that powers our navigation system:

Let's create the API routes to support our Navigation and Layout components. These API endpoints will use our backend services to provide data to the frontend.

# Backend Architecture for Permisoria Navigation System

I've developed a comprehensive backend architecture to support the Permisoria navigation and layout components we created earlier. The implementation follows industry best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability while adhering to the requirements specified in the project documentation.

## Core Backend Architecture Overview

The backend for Permisoria's navigation system is structured around the following key components:

1. **Prisma Schema** - Complete data model definition with appropriate relationships
2. **Service Layer** - Modular, reusable business logic organized by domain
3. **API Layer** - Secure, well-defined endpoints for frontend communication
4. **Authentication & Authorization** - Role-based access control with Supabase integration
5. **Notification System** - Real-time and in-app notifications with Supabase Realtime

### Service Layer Architecture

The service layer follows a domain-driven design approach with clear separation of concerns:

```
/lib/services/
  /auth/          - Authentication and permission management
  /user/          - User profiles and preferences  
  /notification/  - Notification handling and delivery
```

Each service is designed to be:
- **Stateless** - Allowing horizontal scaling
- **Idempotent** - Safe retry operations
- **Composable** - Services can call each other without creating circular dependencies
- **Testable** - Clear inputs and outputs for unit testing

### Database Schema Design

The Prisma schema implements comprehensive relationships between:

- **Users and Roles** - Complete role definition with `UserRole` enum
- **Business Owners and Businesses** - M:N relationship with join table
- **Permits and Businesses** - 1:N relationship with cascading deletes
- **Notifications** - Associated with specific entities and users
- **User Preferences** - Storing theme, language, and notification settings

Key design decisions include:
- **Cascading Deletes** - Ensuring referential integrity
- **Enums** - Using strongly typed enums for status fields
- **JSON Fields** - For flexible metadata storage
- **Composite Indexes** - For relationship performance

### API Layer Implementation

The API endpoints follow RESTful conventions and include:

1. **User Profile API** - For navigation user data (/api/user/profile)
2. **User Preferences API** - For theme and language settings (/api/user/preferences)
3. **Notifications API** - For fetching and managing notifications (/api/notifications)
4. **Notification Count API** - For efficient unread badge display (/api/notifications/count)

Each API endpoint implements:
- **Authentication Checks** - Using Supabase session validation
- **Input Validation** - Ensuring data integrity
- **Error Handling** - Consistent error responses
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript typing throughout

### Authentication Flow

The authentication system is built on Supabase Auth with:

1. **Server-Side Session Validation** - Using cookies for Next.js components
2. **Role-Based Access Control** - Different navigation items per role
3. **User Synchronization** - Between Supabase Auth and Prisma

### Notification Architecture

The notification system implements a hybrid approach:

1. **Database Storage** - For persistence and history
2. **Real-Time Delivery** - Using Supabase Realtime channels
3. **Multi-Channel Support** - In-app, email (SendGrid), potentially SMS

## Implementation Highlights

### Secure Session Management

The `AuthService` creates authenticated Supabase clients using cookie-based sessions:

```typescript
export const createServerSupabaseClient = () => {
  const cookieStore = cookies();
  
  return createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: { /* Cookie handlers */ }
    }
  );
};
```

### Granular Permission Control

The `PermissionService` implements sophisticated permission management:

```typescript
public static hasPermission(userPermissions: string[], requiredPermission: string): boolean {
  // Wildcard support
  if (userPermissions.includes('*')) return true;
  
  const resourceType = requiredPermission.split(':')[0];
  if (userPermissions.includes(`${resourceType}:*`)) return true;
  
  return userPermissions.includes(requiredPermission);
}
```

### Navigation-Specific Data Retrieval

The UserService efficiently retrieves all data needed for the navigation components:

```typescript
public static async getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<any> {
  // Fetches complete user profile with relevant navigation data
  // Including subscription status, business owner verification, etc.
}
```

### Real-Time Notifications

The NotificationService implements real-time broadcasting to Supabase channels:

```typescript
public static async broadcastNotification(notification: Notification): Promise<void> {
  // Broadcasts to user-specific notification channels
}
```

## Security Considerations

The backend implementation includes crucial security measures:

1. **Authentication on Every API Route** - No unauthenticated access
2. **Role Verification** - Navigation items filtered by user role
3. **Data Access Controls** - Users can only access their own data
4. **Input Validation** - On all routes accepting parameters
5. **Error Handling** - Without exposing sensitive details

## Next Steps and Recommendations

To complete the backend implementation for this navigation system:

1. **Create a Frontend Service** - To consume these APIs in the React components
2. **Implement Webhook Handlers** - For Supabase Auth events
3. **Add Server-Side Rendering** - Loading initial state server-side
4. **Create Database Migrations** - For deploying schema changes
5. **Implement Background Jobs** - For notification processing using Supabase Edge Functions

The current implementation provides a robust foundation for the Permisoria navigation system, with secure, type-safe, and scalable backend services powering the stunning frontend components we've already created.
