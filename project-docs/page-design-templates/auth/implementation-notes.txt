Implementation Notes

Folder Structure:
Place all reusable auth components in components/auth/ to maintain organization.
Component Hierarchy:
AuthFormLayout                 // Outer container with layout, title, logo
└── GlassCard                  // Content container with glass effect
    ├── Form Components        // TextInput, Checkbox, etc.
    ├── AuthButton             // Enhanced buttons
    ├── ErrorMessage           // Error display
    ├── PasswordStrengthMeter  // Password strength visualization
    └── VerificationTimeline   // Timeline visualization

Performance Considerations:

Components are designed to be lazy-loaded where appropriate
Animations use GPU-accelerated properties
Background elements conditionally rendered


Accessibility:

Maintained proper contrast ratios
Added appropriate ARIA attributes
Ensured keyboard navigability
Added focus indicators



All files now work together to create a cohesive, engaging authentication flow that embodies Permisoria's premium dark theme aesthetic with improved micro-interactions and visual feedback.
