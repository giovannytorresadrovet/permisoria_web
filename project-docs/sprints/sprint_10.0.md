* `project_summary.md` (Sprint 10: "QA & Finalization")
* `project_requirements_document.md` (Non-Functional Requirements, Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls)
* `frontend_guidelines_document.md` (Testing sections, Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA)
* `security_guideline_document.md` (For final security review checklist)
* `implementation_plan.md` (Original Phase 4, Step 7 validation as E2E test basis)
* All previously created functional and technical documentation.
* Issue/Bug Tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues).
