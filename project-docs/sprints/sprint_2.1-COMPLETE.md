# Sprint 2.1: Frontend Authentication Implementation & Route Protection

**Goal:** Implement the complete frontend authentication flow, including user registration, login, session management via a custom hook, basic "forgot password" initiation, and route protection to secure application areas. This sprint makes the application usable from an authentication perspective.

**Key Documents Referenced:**
* `implementation_plan.md` (Phase 2)
* `app_flow_document.md` (Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up, Error States)
* `frontend_guidelines_document.md` (for UI components, state management - Zustand)
* `security_guideline_document.md` (for auth best practices if applicable to frontend)
* `supabaseClient.ts` (created in Sprint 2.0)
* Common UI Components (Button, Input from Sprint 2.0)

## Task 1: Develop `useAuth` Hook for Authentication Management
* **Status:** [Completed]
* **Progress:** 100%

### Subtask 1.1: Create `useAuth` Hook Structure
* **Status:** [Completed]
* **Progress:** 100%
* **File Path:** `./src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
* **Action:** Define a custom React hook `useAuth`.
* **State Management Integration (Zustand):**
    * Created a Zustand store (`src/stores/authStore.ts`) to hold `user`, `session`, `isLoading`, and `error` states.
    * The `useAuth` hook interacts with this Zustand store to get and set auth state.
    * **Implementation Details:**
        * Added `clearError` and `clearUser` methods to the store for better state management.
        * Used TypeScript for strong typing of the store's state and methods.
        * Included appropriate error handling mechanisms.
* **`useAuth.ts` Hook Implementation:**
    * Implemented using the browser client from `@supabase/ssr` for Supabase Auth integration.
    * Set up auth state listener using `useEffect` to keep store in sync with authentication state.
    * Implemented all required functions:
        * `signUp(email, password, options)`: For user registration with role metadata.
        * `signInWithPassword(email, password)`: For user login.
        * `signOut()`: For user logout with proper state clearing.
        * `resetPasswordForEmail(email)`: For password reset functionality.
        * `onAuthStateChange()`: Automatically updates the Zustand store with user and session information.
    * Returns auth state from store and the implemented functions.
* **Expected Outcome:** A reusable hook that centralizes auth logic and state.
* **Enhancement:** Fixed import issue with createSupabaseClient function to ensure proper authentication flow.
